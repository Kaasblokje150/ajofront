### Customization

You can easily configure the theme. Please change the following file:

- `public/apple-touch-icon.png`, `public/favicon.ico`, `public/favicon-16x16.png` and `public/favicon-32x32.png`: your favicon, you can generate from https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/
- `src/styles/global.css`: your CSS file using Tailwind CSS
- `utils/AppConfig.ts`: configuration file
- `src/pages/index.tsx`: the index page of the theme that uses the `Base` component
- `src/template/Base.tsx`: the `Base` component using component blocks
- `src/templates/*`: the list of component blocks
- `src/*`: other folders in src are the atomic components used by components blocks

Here is the layer:

- the entry point: `index.tsx` in `src/pages`
- the `Base` template: `Base.tsx` in `src/templates`
- use component blocks from `src/templates/*`
- use atomic components from `src/*`

### Deploy to production

You can see the results locally in production mode with:

```
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
```

The generated HTML and CSS files are minified (built-in feature from Next js). It will also removed unused CSS from [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

You can create an optimized production build with:

```
npm run build-prod
```

Now, your theme is ready to be deployed. All generated files are located at `out` folder, which you can deploy with any hosting service.

### VSCode information (optional)

If you are VSCode users, you can have a better integration with VSCode by installing the suggested extension in `.vscode/extension.json`. The starter code comes up with Settings for a seamless integration with VSCode. The Debug configuration is also provided for frontend and backend debugging experience.

Pro tips: if you need a project wide type checking with TypeScript, you can run a build with <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> on Mac.
